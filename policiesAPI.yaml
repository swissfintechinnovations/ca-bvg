    # Policendaten-API (Deutsch)

    **** Deutsch (for English see below) ****

    Mit dem Policendaten-API können Daten zur versicherten Person und zur Police abgefragt werden.
    Dies umfasst vereinfacht gesagt die Daten, die auf dem Versicherungsausweis zu finden sind.
    Auch die Erstellung bzw. das Beziehen von bereits erstellten Versicherungsausweisen als PDF-Datei
    ist möglich.

    Als Einstieg fürs Policendaten-API wird eine technische Personen- oder Policen-ID benötigt.
    Dies wird vom Consent API geliefert.

    Die beiden wesentlichen Objekte dieses APIs sind *Person* und *Police*. Person bezieht sich
    immer auf eine natürliche Person, die bei einer Pensionskasse versichert ist.

    Die Police beschreibt den indirekten Versicherungsvertrag zwischen der versicherten Person
    (ArbeitnehmerIn) und der Pensionskasse. Ist eine Person über zwei Vorsorgepläne versichert,
    z.B. über einen Basis- und einen zusätzlichen Kaderplan, so hat sie zwei Policen.

    Wo es relevant ist, Angaben in den obligatorischen und den über-obligatorischen Teil
    aufzutrennen, wird jeweils das Total (obligatorisch plus über-obligatorisch) und der
    obligatorische Wert separat ausgewiesen. Falls der über-obligatorische Wert benötigt wird, muss
    er vom API-Konsumenten selbst berechnet werden (Differenz zwischen den beiden Werten).

    Ausgenommen davon sind Zinssätze und Umwandlungssätze. Hier werden entweder der obligatorische
    und der über-obligatorische Satz als zwei separate Werte geliefert, oder dann wird der
    umhüllende Satz geliefert.

    Das API umfasst auch die Simulation einer Änderung des Beschäftigtengrads und/oder Lohns. Die
    Simulation berechnet die Effekte auf die monatlichen Beiträge sowie auf die voraussichtlichen
    Rentenleistungen bei unterschiedlichem Penionierungsalter.

    Die in dieser Spezifikation angegebenen URLs sind nur Beispiel-URLs. Das API wird von einer
    Vielzahl von Pensionskassen implementiert und jede Pensionskasse hat eine andere Basis-URL
    für das API. Die Basis-URL der jeweiligen Pensionskasse wird vom Directory API geliefert.


    # Policies API (English)

    **** English (für Deutsch siehe weiter oben) ****

    The Policies API serves to query details about the insured person and insurance policies.
    In simplified terms, this includes the data found on the insurance certificate.
    Additionally, policy statements can be generated or already generated statements can be
    retrieved as PDF files.

    Person and policy IDs serve as the entry point for this API. They are provided by the
    Consent API.

    The two main objects are *person* and *policy*. A person refers to a natural person
    insured with a pension fund.

    A policy describes the indirect contractural relationship between the insured person
    (employee) and the pension fund. If a person is insured by two separate insurance plans,
    e.g. a basic and a supplementary executive plan, the person has two separate plans.

    If it is relevant to distinguish between the mandatory and the supplementary insurance
    coverage, a total value (mandatory and supplementary values combined) and a mandatory
    coverage value are provided seperately. If the value for the supplementary coverage is
    required, the API consumer must calculate it (difference between the two values).

    Interest and conversion rates are the exception to this rule. The pension fund either
    provides two separate values for the mandatory and the supplementary part, or  they
    provide a single enveloping value.

    The API also includes the simulation of a change of employment level and/or salary. It
    calculates the effects on the monthly contributions as well as the effects of the
    perspective pension benefits for different retirement ages.

    The URLs in the specification are examples only. The API is implemented by a many
    pension funds and each pension fund has an individual base URL for the API.
    The base URL of a specific pension fund is provided by the directory API.
